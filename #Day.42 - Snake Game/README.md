## Snake Game

In this Project, I will make a Snake Game using the basics of JavaScript and HTML&CSS.

The basic goal is to navigate a snake and eat as many apple, once it successfully eats the apple, the length of the snake
increases as possible without touching the walls or the snakeâ€™s body.
Then the game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of the four walls of the box.
