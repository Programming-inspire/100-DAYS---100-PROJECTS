## Space-Invaders
In this project, i will learn to make a space invader game.  Space Invader is a simple game where the user as the shooter is expected to go to another side of the grid by destroying the three obstacles coming in between ( the grid would be 15x15 grid).
This game is also like a time-bound game where there is no clock but the obstacles coming ahead become the counter of survival. This is largely based on Switch Cases.
