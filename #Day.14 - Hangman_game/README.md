## HANGMAN-GAME

 Hangman is a simple word guessing game that can be played by one or two people
and categories and words are preloaded in an array and randomly generated for the player to guess.
 Each letter guessed correctly is displayed on the page. For each incorrect guess, a body part is added to the hangman image. 
 If the hangman image is completed before the player can guess the word, they lose the game.
