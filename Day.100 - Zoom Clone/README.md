## Zoom Clone

In this project, I will learn to make a Zoom clone app using Node.js, Express and Socket.io. It uses uuid to make new links so if user want to communicate 
he/she can send that unique link to ones whom to communicate. It makes separate rooms on the basis of unique links.

## Dependencies
- Socket.io
- Express
- ejs
- uuid
- nodemon
- peerjs library
