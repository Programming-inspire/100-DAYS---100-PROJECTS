## Ping-Pong Game

In this Project, I can build the Ping-Pong Game using Javascirpt. It is a two-player table tennis-themed game. The game involves two paddles and a moving ball.
One paddle is control to computer and another paddle is control as Player. The players have to move paddles in an left or right direction and 
save the ball from getting hit onto the wall. If the ball hits the wall then itâ€™s a score for another player.
