## Drawing App

In this project, I will create a neat interactive drawing application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows the user to draw on the canvas. 
You can draw with the help of the cursor. 
Along the way, I'll also learn the basic concepts of the all new <canvas> feature. It can be used for a variety 
of different things, such as drawing graphs, shapes, images, applying styles and colors, making photo compositions, 
  and even some simple, neat animations.
