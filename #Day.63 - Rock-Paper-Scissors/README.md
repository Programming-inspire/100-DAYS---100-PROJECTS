## Rock-Paper-Scissors

 I would learn to make a Rock, paper, and scissors game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this project. It is a fun game and only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player. I will be designing the game using JavaScript where a player will be playing against the computer. The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors. A random option will be generated from the computerâ€™s side and the one who wins will get one point every time. It has shown on the player and computer points.
