## Modal PoPUP-Box

A modal, or dialog box, is a message box that appears in the browser after some specified user interactivity.
 A modal box is not locked to the screen (i.e., the client can navigate away from it without a required interaction), 
 though it is typically the userâ€™s focus (based on your styling of the box). In most instances, if a user wants 
 to dismiss the modal, they can simply close the box with a provided button.
 
## Implementation of a Modal
In order to create and implement a modal on your page, there are three steps that you have to complete for functionality:
 
- HTML: markup to create the modal element
- CSS: styling to determine how your modal looks and appears on the page
- Javascript: placing event listeners so the modal appears/disappears depending on your user interactivity
