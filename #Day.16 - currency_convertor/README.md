## Currency-Convertor

Today I will learn to create a Currency Convertor With HTML CSS JavaScript. I can create a program for comparing money from different countries. Basically, there are two sections for two currencies, you can compare them by switching up and down also you can select any currency from the dropdown and I have used a third-party JSON API for exchanging in real-time.
