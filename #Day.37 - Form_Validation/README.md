## Form Validation
The data entered into a form needs to be in the right format and certain fields need to be filled in order to effectively use the submitted form. 
Username, password, contact information are some details that are mandatory in forms and thus need to be provided by the user.
Above a code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to validate a form.
JavaScript provides facility to validate the form on the client-side so data processing will be faster than server-side validation. 

Through JavaScript, I can validate UserName, Email, Password and again Check your Password.
