## Typing Speed Test

A typing test is designed to find how fast one types in a given amount of time. We will be designing a typing game using JavaScript that presents 
a simple typing challenge and finds the performance of typing by calculating the Characters Per Minute (CPM), Words Per Minute (WPM) and the accuracy of the typed characters. 
A series of quotes that have to be typed in a specified time limit, as fast as possible.
