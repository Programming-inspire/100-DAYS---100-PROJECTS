## Note-taking-app

In this Project, Iâ€™ll develop a simple note-taking application using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, in which we can add, delete and search for our notes. 
The notes will be stored in the local storage of the web browser and they will not be deleted even if the browser is closed.
The application will also prevent HTML and script injections via the input field.
