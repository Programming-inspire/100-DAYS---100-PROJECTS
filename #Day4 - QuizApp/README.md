## Quiz App
Creating a JavaScript quiz is a cool learning exercise. It teaches you how to use events, manipulate the DOM, handle user input.
we want the quiz’s questions and answers to be in our JavaScript code and have our script automatically generate the quiz. 
That way, we won’t need to write a lot of repetitive markup, and we can add and remove questions easily.
