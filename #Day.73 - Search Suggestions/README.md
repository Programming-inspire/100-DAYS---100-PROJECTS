## Search Suggestions

In this project, I will learn to make a Search Suggestions App using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A search box is a graphical UI element present in many websites. 
It works as the field for a query input or searches term from the user to search and retrieve related information from the API or Database. Autocomplete is a pattern
or feature used to display query suggestions and predicts the rest of a word a user is typing.
