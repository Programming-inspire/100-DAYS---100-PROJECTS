## Background-Video with Landing Page

In this Project, i will make a simple landing page with background-video.  A video background that takes up the entire browser window. 
There is text on top of it (hence, “background”), which is an interesting effect that you don’t see every day. 
The biggest reason you don’t, probably, is that you can’t set a movie file as the background-image in CSS. 
You’ll have to do some layout trickery to get it done.
