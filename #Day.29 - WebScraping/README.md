## Web-Scraping with Nodejs

I will be building an IMDB web scraper that will loop through a list of top rated IMDB movies .  (`link: https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/ `)<br>
From there i will be extracting data such as the title of the movie, year of releasing and rating, it will be display in table view into command prompt.

## Dependencies required

- `Nodejs` (not a package but a basic prerequisite)
- `Cheerio` to make the code looks like jQuery (we can perform our task without cheerio also, however, we are more focused on making our code look clean and good)
- `Request` to make http calls that will help us fetch the contents of the website


## How to run

1. Download the respository.
2. Navigate to folder, open cmd to run -> `npm install`
3. run -> `node index.js`
