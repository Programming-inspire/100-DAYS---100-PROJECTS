## Loan Calculator
The Loan Calculator can be used to calculate monthly EMI of the loan by taking the total amount, months to repay and the rate of interest.

## Approach
The approach is very simple, we will take 3 inputs from user.

i.e. 

     - amount (total loan amount), 

     - rate (the rate of interest) and 

     - months (number o months to repay). 
    
Using these three, we can calculate the total amount, interest, total_payment. At last we will display the total amount, interest, total payment.
