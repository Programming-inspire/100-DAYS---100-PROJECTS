## Unicode-Key Generate

In this project, I will learn to make an UniCode-Key Generator using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Key codes is a number which represents an actual key on the keyboard.
These types do not always mean the same thing; for example, a lower case "w" and an upper case "W" have the same keyboard code, because the key that is pressed on 
the keyboard is the same (just "W" = the number "87").
