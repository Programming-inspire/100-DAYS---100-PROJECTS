## Grocery List
  This JavaScript grocery list project is to create a list that accepts an item and also saves it to local storage.
  Every time an item is added, the item is displayed in the DOM and is also saved to the user's local storage.
  If the user clicks the “ Got it ” button, items will be marked as green color.
  If the user clicks the “ Delete ” button, items will be deleted.
