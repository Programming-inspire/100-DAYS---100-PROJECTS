## Hit-a-Mole

In this Project, I can build the Hit-a-Mole game using javascript. It is a simple game in which every time a mole comes out from the ground we have to hit it. 
You get point every time you successfully hit a mole. The purpose of the project is to have an entertainment and fun time with your friends.
