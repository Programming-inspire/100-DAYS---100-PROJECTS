## Simple Calculator

I am going to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
Here, HTML is used for Frontend and CSS is used for styling properties, Javascript for making responsive Frontend and Function.

Dark & Light Mode are also implemented using CSS variables and Javascript.
Attached are the screenshots of Dark and Light Mode.
I added a button which will click calculator it's turn into Light or Dark mode.
