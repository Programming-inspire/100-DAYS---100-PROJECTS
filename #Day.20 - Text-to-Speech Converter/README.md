## Text-to-Speech

The Web Speech API has two functions, speech synthesis, otherwise known as text to speech, and speech recognition. With the SpeechSynthesis API we can command the browser to read out any text in a number of different voices.From a vocal alerts in an application to bringing an Autopilot powered chatbot to life on your website, the Web Speech API has a lot of potential for web interfaces.
