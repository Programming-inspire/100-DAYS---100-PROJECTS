## Voice-Assistent

In this project, I will learn to create a virtual assistant (like Siri or Google assistant) in the browser using HTML,CSS and Javascript. The app can be tested out here,
in which it will listen to the usersâ€™ voice commands and reply with a synthetic voice.

Command: Dark mode, Light mode and open Youtube.
