## Drag & Drop

In this project, i will learn to make a Drag & Drop app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is powerful User Interface concept
which makes it easy to copy, reorder and deletion of items with the help of mouse clicks. This allows the user to click and hold the mouse button down over an element, 
drag it to another location, and release the mouse button to drop the element there.
