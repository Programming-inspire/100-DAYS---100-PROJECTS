## Advanced DropDown-Menu Using React

In this project, I will build an animated multi-level dropdown menu using React. The React Dropdown List is a quick replacement of the HTML select tags. It has a rich appearance and allows users to select a single value that is non-editable from a 
list of predefined values.
