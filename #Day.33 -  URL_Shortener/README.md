## URL Shortener Using Node.js

In this Project, I'll learn about MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, and other technologies by building a simple URL shortener application.
URL shorteners are everywhere, from links you share on twitter to popular services like bit.ly, shorturl etc..

Using links or URLs has been the norm for surfing the web for a long time. Sometimes we need to advertise our businesses on social media.
Long URL links are not the best way to post these links, especially on social media. Doing this will help you promote your products or 
any services with the links provided.

## Using Technologies

- Mongoose as the ORM
- MongoDB as the backend database
- Node.js as the backend
- A simple embedded JS file as the frontend


## How to Run?
1. Download the repository.
2. Navigate to folder, Open cmd to run -> `npm install`
3. Download and install MongoDB.
4. Open new cmd to run -> `mongod`
5. Go to project, cmd to run -> `nodemon`
6. Open the Browser -> `localhost:3000`
