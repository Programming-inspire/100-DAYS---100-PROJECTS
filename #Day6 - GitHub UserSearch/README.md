## The Github Users API

   The Github users API gives you access to a bunch of data about GitHub users like names, followers, images, and many more.
   This URL will give data about the first 30 Github users. But if you want to get access to a specific userâ€™s information, 
   you will have to add the Github username of that specific user at the end of the URL.
   
   Eg: https://api.github.com/users/Programming-Inspire
