## Giphy-Search

In this project, I will learn to create a Gif Search Engine using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The basic application of Gif search Engine is to search the images from the given user 
input keywords and the output of the images will be loaded on the same page provided by Giphy. 
To get the output of the image we will use Giphy EndPoint Search API.
